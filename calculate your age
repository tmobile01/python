import datetime
Year = int(input("What year were you born? "))
Month = int(input("What month were you born? "))
Day = int(input("What day were you born? "))
DOB = datetime.datetime(Year,Month,Day)
Age = (datetime.datetime.now() - DOB)
print("You are " + str(Age.days) + " days old")
convertdays = int(Age.days)
AgeYears = convertdays/365
print("Or" + str(AgeYears) + "years old to be less precise")
